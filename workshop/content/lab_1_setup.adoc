== Environment Setup

Your environment has already been set up and you are ready to deploy your first ROSA cluster.

ROSA is enabled on the AWS account used for this lab - and the ROSA CLI as well as AWS CLI tools are installed and configured on your bastion VM.

There are currently two supported credential methods when creating a ROSA cluster.
One method uses an IAM user with the _AdministratorAccess_ policy (only for the account using ROSA).
The other, more recent, and *recommended* method uses AWS STS.
Please see the section "xref:15-sts_explained.adoc[ROSA with STS Explained]" for a detailed explanation.
In this workshop we will only be using the STS method.

== Connect to your bastion VM

. In the terminal window to the right connect to the bastion VM (you can also just click the command below to have it copied and executed automatically):
+
[source,sh,execute]
----
ssh %rosa_bastion_user_name%@bastion.%rosa_subdomain_base%
----

=== Validate installed tools

You will be using the `rosa`, `aws` and `oc` command line tools throughout this lab.

. Verify that the `rosa` command line tool is installed:
+
[source,sh,execute]
----
rosa version
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
1.2.15
Your ROSA CLI is up to date.
----

. Verify that the `aws` command line tool is installed and configured:
+
[source,sh,execute]
----
aws sts get-caller-identity
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
{
    "UserId": "AIDA52VPS74UJLY4GUW7L",
    "Account": "950629760808",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::950629760808:user/wkulhane@redhat.com-nhnv4"
}
----

. Download and install the oc binary
// don't use `rosa download oc` because it downloads latest 4.12:
+
[source,sh,execute]
----
cd $HOME
wget https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/4.12.9/openshift-client-linux.tar.gz

mkdir $HOME/bin
tar -xzvf $HOME/openshift-client-linux.tar.gz -C $HOME/bin
rm $HOME/openshift-client-linux.tar.gz

export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
----
+
*Why use `oc` over `kubectl`* + Being Kubernetes, one can definitely use `kubectl` with their OpenShift cluster.
`oc` is specific to OpenShift in that it includes the standard set of features from `kubectl` plus additional support for OpenShift functionality. See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cli_reference/openshift_cli/usage-oc-kubectl.html[Usage of oc and kubectl commands] for more details.

. Rosa login
+
[source,sh]
----
rosa login
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
I: Logged in as 'rhpds-cloud' on 'https://api.openshift.com'
----

. Run rosa whoami:
+
[source,sh]
----
rosa whoami

[source,texinfo]

=== Ensure the ELB service role exists

Make sure that the service role for ELB already exists, otherwise the cluster deployment could fail.
As such, run the following to check for the role and create it if it is missing.

 aws iam get-role --role-name "AWSServiceRoleForElasticLoadBalancing" || aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name "elasticloadbalancing.amazonaws.com"

If you received an error during cluster creation like below, then the above should correct it.

 Error: Error creating network Load Balancer: AccessDenied: User: arn:aws:sts::970xxxxxxxxx:assumed-role/ManagedOpenShift-Installer-Role/163xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx is not authorized to perform: iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole on resource: arn:aws:iam::970xxxxxxxxx:role/aws-service-role/elasticloadbalancing.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForElasticLoadBalancing"

=== Log into your Red Hat account

. Enter `rosa login` in a terminal.
. It will prompt you to open a web browser and go to:
+
https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token/rosa

. If you are asked to log in, then please do.
. Click on the "Load token" button.
. Copy the token and paste it back into the CLI prompt and press enter.
Alternatively, you can just copy the full `+rosa login --token=abc...+` command and paste that in the terminal.
+
image::images/1-token.png[CLI Tools]

=== Verify credentials

Verify that all the credentials set up are correctly.

. Run `rosa whoami`
+
You should see an output like below:

  AWS Account ID:               000000000000
  AWS Default Region:           us-east-2
  AWS ARN:                      arn:aws:iam::000000000000:user/myuser
  OCM API:                      https://api.openshift.com
  OCM Account ID:               1DzGIdIhqEWy000000000000000
  OCM Account Name:             Your Name
  OCM Account Username:         you@domain.com
  OCM Account Email:            you@domain.com
  OCM Organization ID:          1HopHfA20000000000000000000
  OCM Organization Name:        Red Hat
  OCM Organization External ID: 0000000

. Please check all information for accuracy before proceeding.

=== Verify quota

Verify that your AWS account has ample quota in the region you will be deploying your cluster to.
Run the following:

 rosa verify quota

Should return a response like

 I: Validating AWS quota...
 I: AWS quota ok. If cluster installation fails, validate actual AWS resource usage against https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_getting_started/rosa-required-aws-service-quotas.html

See https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_planning/rosa-sts-required-aws-service-quotas.html[the documentation] for more details regarding quotas.

=== Verify `oc` CLI

Verify that the `oc` CLI is installed correctly

 rosa verify openshift-client

We have now successfully set up our account and environment and are ready to deploy our cluster.

=== Cluster Deployment

In the next section you will deploy your cluster.
There are two mechanisms to do so:

* Using the ROSA CLI
* Using the OCM Web User Interface

Either way is perfectly fine for the purposes of this workshop.
Though keep in mind that if you are using the OCM UI, there will be a few extra steps to set it up in order to deploy into your AWS account for the first time.
This will not need to be repeated for subsequent deployments using the OCM UI for the same AWS account.

Please select the desired mechanism in the left menu under "Deploy the cluster".
