== Leveraging Source-to-Image (S2I) webhooks for automated deployment

If we'd like to automatically trigger a build and deploy anytime we change the source code we can do that by using a webhook.

See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cicd/builds/triggering-builds-build-hooks.html[Triggering Builds] for more details.

==== Get the trigger secret

Retrieve the GitHub webhook trigger secret using the command below.
You'll need use this secret in the GitHub webhook URL.

 oc get bc/ostoy-microservice -o=jsonpath='{.spec.triggers..github.secret}'

You will get a response similar to: `o_3x9M1qoI2Wj_cz1WiK`

Note the secret as you will need to use it shortly.

[discrete]
==== Retrieve the GitHub webhook trigger URL

You will need to get the GitHub webhook trigger URL from the buildconfig.
Use following command to retrieve it

 oc describe bc/ostoy-microservice

You will get a response with much data but look about two-thirds the way down for the line that looks like:

 [...]
 Webhook GitHub:
 	URL:	https://api.demo1234.openshift.com:443/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/ostoy-s2i/buildconfigs/ostoy/webhooks/<secret>/github
 [...]

==== Replace the secret

In the URL retrieved in the last step replace the `<secret>` text with the actual secret you received in step 1 above.
Your URL will look like:

 https://api.demo1234.openshift.com:443/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/ostoy-s2i/buildconfigs/ostoy-microservice/webhooks/o_3x9M1qoI2Wj_czR1WiK/github

==== Setup the webhook URL in GitHub repository

* In your repository, click on _Settings > Webhooks > Add webhook_
+

* Paste the URL from step 4 into the "Payload URL" field
* Change the "Content type" to `application/json`
* Click add webhook at the bottom
+
image::images/11-webhookfinish.png[Finish Add Webhook]

You should see a message from GitHub stating that your webhook was successfully configured.
Now, whenever you push a change to your GitHub repository, a new build will automatically start, and upon a successful build a new deployment will start.

[discrete]
==== Make a change and see the update

Now we will make a change in our source code and see it automatically trigger a build and deployment.
We saw in our Networking section that the colors of the box randomly change colors.
Now we will make that box only display greyscale.

* Go to the source code in your repository

   https://github.com/<username>/ostoy/blob/master/microservice/app.js

* Edit the file
* Comment out line 8 (containing `let randomColor = getRandomColor();`)
* Uncomment line 9 (containing `let randomColor = getRandomGrayScaleColor();`)
+
```js hl_lines="3" linenums="7"   app.get('/', function(request, response) { 	//let randomColor = getRandomColor();
// <-- comment this 	let randomColor = getRandomGrayScaleColor();
// <-- uncomment this

 response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'application/json'});   ```

* Enter a message for the update like "changed box to greyscale colors"
* Click _Commit_ at the bottom to commit the changes to the master branch

==== View the build run and Deployment complete

Immediately, in your cluster web UI, click under _Builds > Builds_ and you will see that it says "running" then it will show "complete".
Once complete the deployment begins.
You can also check the status by running `oc status`.

==== View change in browser

Once the deployment has finished go back to OSToy app in your browser, access the _Networking_ menu item on the left.
You will now see that the box color is limited to greyscale colors only.
