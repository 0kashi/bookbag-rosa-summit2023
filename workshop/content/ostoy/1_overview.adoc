== Resources

* The source code for this app is available here: https://github.com/openshift-cs/ostoy

[NOTE]
====
In order to simplify the deployment of the app we have included all the objects needed in the above deployment manifests as an "all-in-one" manifest.
Though in reality, an enterprise would most likely want to have a different manifest file for each Kubernetes object.

== About OSToy

OSToy is a simple Node.js application that we will deploy to ROSA.
It is used to help us explore the functionality of Kubernetes.
This application has a user interface where you can:

* write messages to the log (stdout / stderr)
* intentionally crash the application to view self-healing
* toggle a liveness probe and monitor OpenShift behavior
* read config maps, secrets, and env variables
* if connected to shared storage, read and write files
* check network connectivity, intra-cluster DNS, and intra-communication with an included microservice
* increase the load to view automatic scaling of the pods to handle the load (via the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)
* connect to an AWS S3 bucket to read and write objects (Optional)
