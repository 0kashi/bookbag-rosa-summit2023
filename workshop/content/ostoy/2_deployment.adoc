== Deploy via a Kubernetes Deployment

One way to deploy the application would be to have the images for the front-end and back-end microservice containers already created (via CI/CD) and stored in an image repository.
You can then create Kubernetes deployments (YAML) and use those to deploy the application.
We will do that now.

=== Create new project

. Create a new project in your cluster by entering the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc new-project ostoy-${GUID}
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
Now using project "ostoy-6xjt6" on server "https://api.rosa-6xjt6.qkm6.p1.openshiftapps.com:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.33 -- /agnhost serve-hostname
----

=== Deploy the backend microservice

The microservice serves internal web requests and returns a JSON object containing the current hostname and a randomly generated color string.

. In your terminal deploy the microservice using the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc apply -n ostoy-${GUID} -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-cs/rosaworkshop/master/rosa-workshop/ostoy/yaml/ostoy-microservice-deployment.yaml
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
deployment.apps/ostoy-microservice created
service/ostoy-microservice-svc created
----

=== Deploy the front-end service

The frontend deployment contains the node.js frontend for our application along with a few other Kubernetes objects.

If you open the _ostoy-frontend-deployment.yaml_ you will see we are defining:

* Persistent Volume Claim
* Deployment Object
* Service
* Route
* Configmaps
* Secrets

. In your terminal, deploy the frontend along with creating all objects mentioned above by entering:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc apply -n ostoy-${GUID} -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-cs/rosaworkshop/master/rosa-workshop/ostoy/yaml/ostoy-frontend-deployment.yaml
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
persistentvolumeclaim/ostoy-pvc created
deployment.apps/ostoy-frontend created
service/ostoy-frontend-svc created
route.route.openshift.io/ostoy-route created
secret/ostoy-secret-env created
configmap/ostoy-configmap-files created
secret/ostoy-secret created
----

=== Get the route

. Get the route so that we can access the application.
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get route ostoy-route -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}' -n ostoy-${GUID}
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
ostoy-route-ostoy-6xjt6.apps.rosa-6xjt6.qkm6.p1.openshiftapps.com
----

=== View the app

Copy the host name of your route above and paste it into your browser and press enter.

You should see the homepage of our application.

If the page does not come up make sure that it is using `http` and *not* `https`.
